Your job will be to submit a slightly modified version of your community contribution .Rmd file to the GitHub repository where the source files for this web site are stored. On the backend, the admins will divide the chapters into book sections and order them. We use Travis CI to render the book and push the rendered .html files to our gh-pages branch–you can view our builds here–and GitHub Pages to host the site. If your community contribution is in a different format, then create a short .Rmd file that explains what you did, and includes links to any relevant files, such as slides, etc. which you can post on your GitHub repo (or another online site.) 1.2 Preparing your .Rmd file After completing these modifications, your .Rmd should look like this sample bookdown .Rmd. Create a concise, descriptive name for your project. For instance, name it base_r_ggplot_graph or something similar if your work is about contrasting/working with base R graphics and ggplot2 graphics. Check the .Rmd filenames in the project repo to make sure your name isn’t already taken. Your project name should be words only and joined with underscores, i.e. Do not include whitespace in the name. Create a copy of your .Rmd file with the new name. Completely delete the YAML header (the section at the top of the .Rmd that includes name, title, date, output, etc.) including the --- line. The first line should be a single hashtag (#) followed by your project name (this does not have to be exact same as the project folder name and may include white space). Do not use single # headers anywhere else in the document. The second line should be blank, followed by your name(s): # Base R graphics vs. ggplot2 graphics Aaron Burr and Alexander Hamilton Your content starts here. If your project requires data, please use a built-in dataset or read directly from a URL, such as: df &lt;- readr::read_csv(&quot;https://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/data/csv/addresses.csv&quot;) If you absolutely must include a data file, please use a small one, as for many reasons it is desirable to keep the repository size as small as possible. Want to get fancy? See the optional tweaks section below. 1.3 Submission Steps To submit your work, we will be following the instructions in this tutorial, which are provided in abbreviated form below, with specific instructions on naming conventions, content information, and other important details. Fork cc19 repo (this repo) to your GitHub account. Clone/download the forked repo to your local computer. Create a new branch and name it with your project name, in our case sample_project. Copy your modified .Rmd file with the same name into the root directory on the branch. In our example, it is sample_project.Rmd. Do not include an .html file. (In order for the bookdown package to work, all .Rmd files will be rendered behind the scenes.) [OPTIONAL] If you have other resources (such as images) included in your project, create a folder under resources/. In our example, it is resources/sample_project/. Put the resources files there. When you are ready to submit your project, push your branch to your remote repo. Follow this tutorial to create a pull request. If you follow the steps, we will merge it to the master branch. 1.4 Optional tweaks If you prefer for links from your chapter to open in new tabs, add {target=&quot;_blank&quot;} after the link, such as: [edav.info](edav.info){target=&quot;_blank&quot;} Note that your headers (##, ###, etc.) will be converted to numbered headings as such: ## –&gt; 3.1 ### –&gt; 3.1.1 These headings will appear as chapter subheadings and sub-subheadings in the navigation panel on the left. Think about a logical structure for users to navigate your chapter. We recommend using only ## and ### headings as subheadings such as 4.1.3.4 are generally not necessary and look messy. Unfortunately, there’s no simple way to preview your chapter before it’s actually merged into the project. (bookdown has preview_chapter() option but it only works after the entire book has been rendered at least once and that will become more and more complex and require more and more packages as the project grows.) If you really want to preview it, fork and clone this minimal bookdown repo, add your .Rmd file, click the “Build book” button on the Build tab (next to Git), and then open any of the .html files in the _book folder in a web browser to see the rendered book. (Do not click the Knit button as it will not build a bookdown book.) If you’re interested in more bookdown options, see the official reference book. Have more useful tweaks to share? Submit an issue or PR. 1.5 FAQ 1.5.1 What should I expect after creating a pull request? Within a week after you create a pull request, we will apply a label to it and assign an administrater who will review all the files you submit to see if they meet the requirements. It will take some time before we can process all the pull requests, so as long as you see your pull request has been labeled and assigned to an administrater, don’t worry. However, if the admin contacts you regarding the pull request, that usually means your files fail to meet some requirements. The admin will clearly state what is wrong, so please fix them as soon as possible. 1.5.2 What if I catch mistakes after my pull request is merged? You may submit additional pull requests to fix material on the site. If the edits are small, such as fixing typos, it is easiest to make the edits directly on GitHub, following these instructions. We will merge first pull requests before edits, so please be patient. 1.5.3 Other questions If you encounter other problems, please submit an issue and we will look into it. Thank you for your contributions! "],
